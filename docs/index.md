This cookbook is supposed to help you with typing your nextcord bot.
It is not supposed to be a tutorial on how to use nextcord, but rather a guide on how to type your bot.
You should have a rather good understanding of nextcord before reading and applying this cookbook.

I'd recommend you'd get started with [best practices](./bestpractices.md) when typing your bot.
